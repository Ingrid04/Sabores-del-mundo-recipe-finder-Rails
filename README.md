# README

1- Project Title: 'Sabores del Mundo' - Recipe Finder.
I created a rails application from scratch without using scaffold.

2- Installed the gems I needed, like bcrypt' for using has_secure_password, 'devise',
'dotenv-rails', "omniauth", 'omniauth-google-oauth2' among others.

3- Running the tests: Ensure I can run the server and preview the application.

4 - Ensure the Controllers work

5- Ensure I have appropriate routes, included nested routes that were necessary for this project.

6- Create a homepage where I put all the necessaries links and buttons for the user to interact with my app like the login, sign up, login with google links.

7- Create efficiently the flow of the app to make it comfortable for the user. That includes the validations, restrictions like other users can not edit or delete a user's recipe.

8- Also create helpers methods to make an easier way to call those methods in other files.

9- Create partial forms to "write less code" and reuse a code that I can use in other file too.

10- Styling my app with css. I use bootstrap too.
